# Weather-app-Frontend-
This is my first vanilla Web Dev project using third party API which gives the real time data about the weather of a place.

Projct contains 4 fiels in total
1. index.html
2. app.js
3. ui.js
4. fetch.js

Here, I have used bootstrap framework to implement CSS.
Third party API from openweather.org was used.
